# DevOps & SDLC

## 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Understand the relationship between DevOps and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- **Why it matters**: Modern software development requires speed, quality, and collaboration—DevOps enhances SDLC to achieve these goals.

---

## 2. Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### Phases of SDLC:
1. **Planning** – Requirements gathering, feasibility study.
2. **Design** – System architecture, prototypes.
3. **Development** – Coding, version control.
4. **Testing** – QA, bug fixing.
5. **Deployment** – Release to production.
6. **Maintenance** – Updates, patches.

### Traditional SDLC Challenges:
- Slow releases
- Siloed teams (Dev vs. Ops)
- Manual processes leading to errors

## 3. Introduction to DevOps
### What is DevOps?
- A culture, practice, and set of tools that **bridge Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops)**.
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Automation** (CI/CD pipelines)
  - **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
  - **Monitoring & Feedback**
  - **Collaboration & Shared Responsibility**

### DevOps Tools:
| Category               | Tools                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Version Control**     | Git, GitHub, GitLab           |
| **CI/CD**              | Jenkins, GitHub Actions       |
| **Configuration Mgmt**  | Ansible, Puppet, Chef         |
| **Containerization**   | Docker, Kubernetes            |
| **Monitoring**         | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack|

## 4. Integrating DevOps with SDLC
### DevOps in Each SDLC Phase:
| **SDLC Phase**  | **DevOps Practices**                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Planning       | Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Agile planning|
| Design         | Scalable architecture, cloud solutions     |
| Development    | Version control, peer reviews              |
| Testing        | Automated testing (unit, integration, load)|
| Deployment     | CI/CD pipelines, blue-green deployments    |
| Maintenance    | Logging, monitoring, incident response     |

### Benefits of DevOps in SDLC:
✔ **Faster releases** (Agile & Automation)  
✔ **Higher reliability** (Automated testing & rollback)  
✔ **Better collaboration** (Breaking silos)

## 5. Case Studies and Real-World Examples
### Case Study 1: Netflix
- **Challenge**: Needed frequent updates without downtime.
- **Solution**:
  - Microservices architecture
  - Chaos Engineering (Simulating failures)
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines

### Case Study 2: Amazon
- **Challenge**: Manual deployments caused delays.
- **Solution**:
  - **DevOps adoption**: 10,000+ deployments per day
  - **AWS DevOps tools** (CodePipeline, CodeDeploy)

## 6. Interactive Activity: DevOps in Action
DevOps operates through a **continuous loop** of collaboration, automation, and feedback across the SDLC:

1. **Plan**  
   - Agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban) prioritize tasks.
   - Tools: Jira, Trello, Azure DevOps.
2. **Code**  
   - Developers use **version control** (Git) for collaborative coding.
   - Tools: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
3. **Build & Test**  
   - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Code changes are automatically built, tested, and merged.
   - Automated testing (unit, integration, security).
   - Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions.
4. **Deploy**  
   - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically release code to production.
   - Strategies: Blue-Green, Canary, Rolling deployments.
   - Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CodeDeploy.
5. **Operate**  
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) manages servers (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
   - Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP) enable scalability.
6. **Monitor**  
   - Real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure.
   - Feedback loops for rapid bug fixes.
   - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.

## Conclusion
DevOps transforms SDLC by fostering automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.
